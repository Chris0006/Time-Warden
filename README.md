# Time-Warden
Productivity Program For Windows

The app works by allowing you to set a time limit for each program or app, 
and then automatically closing or locking the program once the time limit 
has been reached. This can help you avoid wasting time on non-essential 
tasks and stay focused on your most important work.



For example, let's say you want to limit your time spent on social media to 30 minutes per day. You could use the app to set a time limit for your social media app, and once 30 minutes have passed, the app would automatically close or lock the social media app, preventing you from wasting more time on it.
